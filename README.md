## This Project
Hello there, my name is Xu Jie and this is my blog repository for my web developer journey with [Trent Global Colleague](https://trentglobal.edu.sg/software-development-bootcamp/). 

This project will serve as a start point of my transition from videographer to software developer:
- Think of this repo as a place to pen down thoughts for the each day
- Share to future aspiring developers or students

1. Get into a rhythm of learning code, without losing income.
2. Network with a larger community of aspiring developers on the course.
3. Getting certification for future employers
4. Create more projects to add to my portfolio

One might argue all this can be archive without a bootcamp and that's true, **shoutout to all self-taught developers out there!** Yet I've found this to be the right balance between a full-time job and transiting
