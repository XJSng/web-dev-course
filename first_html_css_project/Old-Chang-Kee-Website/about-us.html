              Old Chang Kee has its humble beginnings in 1956 in a small stall
              in a coffee shop near the then Rex Cinema along Mackenzie Road.
              People from every corner of Singapore would travel to this stall
              to savor the perfect curry puff, then known affectionately as the
              "Rex Curry Puff". Singaporeans have fond memories of the pleasure
              of every bite of the puff. They loved the delicious puff,
              painstakingly made and stuffed with a slice of egg, curry potato
              and chicken, all fried with specially selected spices and herbs.
              The unmistaken aroma of Old Chang Kee curry puff has since won the
              hearts of many Singaporeans, both young and old.

              In 1986, Mr. Han Keen Juan made a pivotal decision that was to
              change his life as well as the food scene in Singapore. He traded
              a comfortable job with an established MNC for the hot and greasy
              kitchen of Old Chang Kee. With whatever savings he had, he bought
              over the control of the Old Chang Kee business. And he had only
              one goal in mind - to transform Old Chang Kee into a successful
              business.

          </div>
          <div class="collapse" id="collapse-growth">
            <div class="card card-body">
              With a clear vision, Mr. Han quickly set about modernizing and
              re-engineering the business. He moved the production of the curry
              puffs from a small corner in a coffee shop to a slightly larger
              premise in Ubi. New systems were implemented and critical steps
              were taken to ensure consistency in the quality of the products.
              He knew that to bring the business into the big league, he needed
              to continuously upgrade the production facility. In his true
              entrepreneur spirit, he later took another major decision. He
              invested in a 20,000 sq. feet modern production facility in
              Woodlands. Aggressive programmes were launched to grow Old Chang
              Kee into a leading brand of curry puffs and hot savouries. Mr.
              Han's efforts did not go unnoticed. He was awarded the
              Entrepreneur of the Year award in 1992 and Newsweek and the now
              defunct Asia Magazine named him as a man to watch. Having brought
              Old Chang Kee to where it was, Mr. Han realized then that he
              needed someone to help him to bring the business to another level.
              Mr. William Lim, a graduate of an Australian university, was
              brought into the company. Fresh ideas and innovative marketing
              strategies, in sync with changing consumer trends, were
              implemented. Old Chang Kee has since evolved. It now specializes
              in the manufacture and sales of a wide range of very affordable
              high quality food products including the signature curry puff.
              Production is carried out in a modern factory and high-end
              technology and stringent quality control measures ensure that the
              exacting standard, that is synonymous with the Old Chang Kee
              brand, is consistently achieved. All production processes and
              facilities are certified to have met HACCP and Halal standards.
              Old Chang Kee now markets its range of snack products, including
              its signature curry puffs, through kiosks along the road and
              retail outlets at petrol kiosks and shopping malls. Old Chang Kee
              was admitted to the Official List of the Catalist in 2008. The U.S
              based Travel & Leisure Magazine announced in May 2012 that Old
              Chang Kee was selected as one of the world's 20 best fast food
              chains. We were the only brand from Singapore to have the honour
              of being included in the list.
